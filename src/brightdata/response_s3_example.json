His technical expertise has proven invaluable as well as his general readiness to contribute and work with the team. He is well equipped enough to make decisions on his own. I find he can work either independently or as an integrated team member. All tasks that we were given to him have always come in on time and as specified. Has a lot of technical content and Analytical skills. Not only is he an expert in JAVA, Spring Boot, Apache Kafka and other technologies, but he also has good understanding of Information Technology and Computer Science fundamentals.. One that will always make a major contribution to any project.”",
